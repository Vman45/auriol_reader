Prototype web interface for AURIOL H13726 weather station on Raspberry Pi.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data is received via cheap chinese receiver XY-MK-5V.
It's a prototype so repo and code is a mess. But it works :)
You can use and do everything You want with it.

auriol-reader - reads and decodes radio transmissions from pluviometer and
anemometer devices.

gpio-poller - polls GPIO and prints data to stdout

db - sqlite3 data recording utility

www - web page

*.plt - configurations for Gnuplot

and some messy scripts to keep thing working in background and start after Pi
reboot etc, restart once a day just in case etc.

This project uses Wiring Pi library (http://wiringpi.com/) so You should
install it first.

Magic spell to build this thing:
$  gcc -Wall -ansi -o build/auriol-pluviometer-reader -I/usr/local/include
-L/usr/local/lib -lwiringPi -lrt -lsqlite3 auriol-reader.c db.c

Have a nice day :)
